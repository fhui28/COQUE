Description: COQUE is an computationally scalable (at least at the time of development!) approach to performing joint clustering and variable selection of fixed effect coefficients in multivariate longitudinal/independent cluster mixed models. The method works by first fitting separate/stacked univariate longitudinal mixed models to each of the responses (in parallel). The model estimates into a quadratic form resembling that of a composite likelihood multivariate Wald statistic. We then augment the composite quadratic form with broken adaptive ridge regression penalties to encourage sparsity and clustering of the fixed effect coefficients.
